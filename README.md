Cordova Plugin for OpenTok iOS
===

This is a fork of IjzerenHein/cordova-plugin-opentok plugin with these added functionalities:

- Bug corrections on IOS (The _publiher variable was being initialzied on a thread which was giving null exception sometimes).
- Changed order of views so the web view is in front of the video views, thus making you able to render html content on top of the videos.
